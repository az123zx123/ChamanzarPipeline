=====
The analysis of neural activity through extracellular recordings is one of the most common and powerful tools in the field of neuroscience for this purpose.
The extracellular recording is obtained by implanting electrodes in the brain tissue to detect the electrical activity of nearby neurons.
Spike sorting is a commonly used analysis method for identifying neural activity as spike events in extracellular recordings.
